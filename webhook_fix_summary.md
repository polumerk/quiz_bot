# Webhook Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The Telegram Quiz Bot was failing to run in webhook mode on Replit due to incorrect port configuration and webhook URL handling conflicts.

### Root Cause Analysis

From the logs, the issue was:

1. **Incorrect Port Configuration**: The bot was trying to run on port 443 (HTTPS) but Replit requires apps to run on port 8080 with HTTPS termination handled by the platform.

2. **Webhook URL Conflicts**: The bot was manually setting the webhook URL correctly, but then `app.run_webhook()` was overriding it with an invalid `http://0.0.0.0:443/...` URL.

3. **HTTP/HTTPS Mismatch**: The library was trying to set webhook with HTTP protocol on port 443, which is invalid.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Port Configuration Fix (`src/config.py`)

**Changes:**
- Changed default `WEBHOOK_PORT` from `443` to `8080` for Replit compatibility
- Added `get_webhook_port()` method to return appropriate port for each environment:
  - Replit: port 8080 (HTTPS handled by platform)
  - Other environments: port 443 or custom

```python
# Before
WEBHOOK_PORT: int = int(os.getenv('WEBHOOK_PORT', '443'))

# After  
WEBHOOK_PORT: int = int(os.getenv('WEBHOOK_PORT', '8080'))  # Changed for Replit

@classmethod
def get_webhook_port(cls) -> int:
    """Get the appropriate webhook port for the current environment"""
    if cls.is_replit_environment():
        return int(os.getenv('WEBHOOK_PORT', '8080'))
    else:
        return int(os.getenv('WEBHOOK_PORT', '443'))
```

### 2. Webhook Setup Logic Fix (`main.py`)

**Changes:**
- Replaced manual webhook setup with proper library integration
- Modified `setup_webhook()` to `get_webhook_config()` - returns config instead of setting webhook
- Updated `app.run_webhook()` to receive both `webhook_url` and `url_path` parameters
- Let the python-telegram-bot library handle webhook setup properly

```python
# Before - Manual webhook setup with conflicts
async def setup_webhook(app) -> Optional[str]:
    # ... set webhook manually
    response = await app.bot.set_webhook(full_webhook_url)
    # ... then run_webhook() overrides it

# After - Proper library integration
async def get_webhook_config() -> Optional[tuple[str, str]]:
    # ... return webhook config
    return full_webhook_url, webhook_path

# Usage
webhook_url, webhook_path = webhook_config
await app.run_webhook(
    listen=config.WEBHOOK_LISTEN,
    port=webhook_port,
    url_path=webhook_path,
    webhook_url=webhook_url  # Proper parameter passing
)
```

### 3. Environment-Specific Configuration

**Replit Environment:**
- Uses port 8080 for HTTP server
- HTTPS termination handled by Replit platform
- Webhook URL: `https://domain.replit.dev/TOKEN`
- Server listens on: `0.0.0.0:8080`

**Other Environments:**
- Uses port 443 or custom port
- Direct HTTPS handling if needed
- Configurable via `WEBHOOK_PORT` environment variable

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Replit Deployment**: Bot runs on port 8080, webhook URL properly configured with HTTPS
2. **Other Platforms**: Bot uses appropriate port configuration for the environment
3. **Fallback**: If webhook fails, automatic fallback to polling mode
4. **No Conflicts**: Library handles webhook setup without URL override issues

## Files Modified

- `src/config.py`: Port configuration and environment detection
- `main.py`: Webhook setup logic and library integration

## Testing

The fix has been applied and tested:
- ✅ Code syntax is correct (no import/syntax errors)
- ✅ Environment detection works properly
- ✅ Port configuration adapts to environment
- ✅ Webhook URL formatting is correct
- ✅ Fallback to polling mode works

## Benefits

- **Replit Compatible**: Works properly in Replit environment
- **Multi-Platform**: Adapts to different deployment environments
- **Robust**: Automatic fallback if webhook fails
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and proper error handling

The webhook configuration is now properly set up for deployment on Replit and other platforms.
